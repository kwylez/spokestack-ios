# Spokestack iOS

Spokestack provides an extensible speech recognition pipeline for the iOS
platform. It includes a variety of built-in speech processors for Voice
Activity Detection (VAD) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) via popular
speech recognition services, such as the Google Speech API.

## Installation
[![](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/SpokeStack.svg)](https://cocoapods.org/pods/SpokeStack)

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Spokestack into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

`pod 'Spokestack', '~> 0.0.2'`

## Release
  1. Ensure that CocoaPods has been installed via `gem`, not via `brew`
  2. Increment the `podspec` version in `SpokeStack.podspec`
  3. `git commit -a -m 'YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE' && git tag YOUR_PODSPEC_VERSION && git push --origin`
  4. `pod spec lint`, which should pass all but one checks (expect `ERROR | [iOS] xcodebuild: Returned an unsuccessful exit code. You can use `--verbose` for more information.`)
  5. edit `/Library/Ruby/Gems/YOUR_RUBY_VERSION/gems/cocoapods-trunk-YOUR_COCOAPODS_VERSION/lib/pod/command/trunk/push.rb`, comment out `validate_podspec_files` (https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/master/lib/cocoapods/command/repo/push.rb#L77)
  6. `pod trunk register YOUR_EMAIL --description='release YOUR_PODSPEC_VERSION'`
  7. `pod trunk push SpokeStack.podspec`
  8. remove comment inserted in step 5.
Due to static library dependencies not distributed as universal binaries, thereâ€™s no way to make `pod spec lint` or `pod lib lint` complete successfully. Aside from `x86_64`/`iphonesimulator` not being a supported architecture, the `podspec` is complete and correct. This release approach, while not conforming to the standard CocoaPods release process, is understood to be valid (https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/5801#issuecomment-244520442).
